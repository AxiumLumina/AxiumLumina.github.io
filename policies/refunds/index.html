                        the terms outlined in the policies below set clear expectations regarding refunds.
						However, we reserve the right to, outside the terms below,
                        additionally grant refunds, discounts or waive fees at our sole discretion,
                        should we believe it is appropriate to do so.

				and initiate work.<br>

				Deposits compensate for time spent on consultations, initial research,
				planning, and blocking other work.<br>

				If a client chooses to cancel the project after making the deposit payment,
				the deposit will not be refunded.<br></p>

					<h2>Project Cancellation by Axium Lumina</h2>
					<p>If we need to cancel the project for reasons within our control
						(e.g., personal emergency), a pro-rated refund will be considered
						based on the uncompleted work.<br>

						In cases where no substantial work has started,
						a full refund of payments may be issued.</p>

				<div class="content-box">
					<h2>Project Cancellation by Clients</h2>
					<p>
						If a client cancels the project for any reason,
						all payments made up to the cancellation date are non-refundable.<br>

						Any work completed will be delivered in its current state (if applicable),
						but no further obligations will exist on our part.
