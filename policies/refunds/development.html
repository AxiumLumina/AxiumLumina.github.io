                    <p>For projects divided into milestones or phases,
				payments for each completed milestone are non-refundable.<br>

				If a project is terminated by a client before a milestone is reached,
				we reserve the right to retain payment for work completed up to that point,
				and in most cases, no refunds will be issued.<br>

                    <p>Reasonable effort will be made to deliver work aligned
				with pre-agreed specifications and requirements.<br>

				Revision requests must be made within the agreed project scope.
				If a client requests changes beyond the original scope,
				additional charges will apply.<br><br>

				Dissatisfaction with creative choices, subjective preferences,
				or changes in business direction on a client’s
				side will not qualify for refunds.<br><br>

				Refunds due to dissatisfaction will only be considered if:<br>
				The delivered work fails to meet clearly documented and
				mutually agreed requirements, and<br>
				Reasonable opportunities for revisions have been provided, and<br>
				we are unable to meet the requirements within a reasonable timeframe.<br><br>

				If a project is terminated by a client before a milestone is reached,
				we reserve the right to retain payment for work completed up to that point,
				and in most cases, no refunds will be issued.<br></p>

				client’s project.<br>
				As such, once work is delivered, no refunds will be issued.<br>

				Clients are encouraged to review all work at each milestone to ensure satisfaction.</p>
